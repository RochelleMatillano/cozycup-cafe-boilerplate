        <p>Café Story</p> <br> 
        <p>Welcome to Cozy Cafe, where every sip is a story and every moment 
            is crafted with warmth. Our journey began with a simple idea - 
            to create a space where coffee isn't just a beverage; it's an 
            experience. Nestled in the heart of Puerto Princesa City, Cozy Cafe emerged 
            as a haven for those seeking solace from the daily hustle, a place 
            where the aroma of freshly brewed coffee intertwines with the joy of 
            connecting.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Origins:</p> <br>
        <p>Founded in 2020, Cozy Cafe started as a dream shared by coffee
             enthusiasts who wanted to redefine the café experience. From carefully 
             selecting the finest coffee beans to curating a menu that blends global
              flavors with local charm, every detail at Cozy Cafe reflects our commitment 
              to quality.
